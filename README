A simple application around the Pale Blue Dot project, to make it easier to adopt a star.

More info about the Pale Blue Dot project:

This project is not in any way associated with Pale Blue Dot; it's just me. But who knows that might change.

At the moment, it doesn't do anything useful except show a list of stars. Here's a list of possible improvements (for I which I don't have time, so patches are welcome):

* search by other criteria, e.g. 
** range of brightness (http://www.spaceacademy.net.au/library/notes/magntude.htm)
** not adopted yet
** region
* google sky mashup
* Facebook / Etc integration, e.g.
** show your friend's stars on map
** find a bright star near your friends
* search for cool astronomic coincidences, e.g.
** eclipsed by Jupiter on your birthday
* etc, etc

Installation:

Step 1:
Install ruby on rails on your machine.

Step 2:

create database kepler;

Create the stars table:
rake db:mgirate
