A simple application around the Pale Blue Dot project, to make it easier to adopt a star.

More info about the Pale Blue Dot project:

This project is not in any way associated with Pale Blue Dot; it's just me. But who knows that might change.

At the moment, it doesn't do anything useful except show a list of stars. Here's a list of possible improvements (for I which I don't have time, so patches are welcome):

* Facebook / Etc integration, e.g.
** show your friend's stars on map
** find a bright star near your friends
* search for cool astronomic coincidences, e.g.
** eclipsed by Jupiter on your birthday
* etc, etc

Installation:

Install ruby on rails on your machine.
